This project will help the user to find all necessary information about vehicle registration in Ukraine.

The main functionality of this project is searching for information about registrations in Open Data that is available on government resources. Some examples of this data can be:

- Vehicle Brand
- Vehicle Model
- Vehicle Registration Number
- Vehicle Color
- etc

So, as a result, each one will be able to check the registration of each vehicle that exists through Open Data records.
